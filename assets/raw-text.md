Your leadership of Digital / UCD has been one of the most positive experiences of my career.
The work completed and the culture developed is one of the reasons I continue to enjoy working at the Bureau so much.
I wish you all the best in your new role and hope you are able to aspire and accomplish as much there as you have here.

Thank you for your strong, fair and caring leadership. May your journey into the future be a voyage of discovery across smooth seas to gilded shores.
Vaya con dios!

Thanks for having me as part of UCD =)
Sad to see you go but your new role sounds great.
All the best and thank you for always being supportive and positive towards us (and me when we presented public safely)

You've been such a huge positive influence to the Digital / ICD teams.
You have trusted the expertise of your staff, championed the cause, lifted our profile and the respect afforded to the team throughout the organisation.
I'm sure you will be a huge asset and good influence in your new role, but you will be hard to replace here!

THanks to your leadership and guidance, this program is the best one to work for (IMHO). It's been great working with you, your new team is very luck.
Best of luck and have fun with it.

It has been an absolute pleasure working under your leadership.
Your receptiveness and enthusiasm with innovation and ideas really helped shape up our team in a positive way.
All the best with the future.
Sad to see you go!
